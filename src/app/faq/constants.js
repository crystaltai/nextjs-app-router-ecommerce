    The XYZ tokens were deployed on an ERC20 smart contract through Thirdweb.
    The contract contains numerous extensions, including the transfer function.
    <br />
    <br />
    When you sign the transaction to redeem an XYZ reward, one blockchain
    transaction occurs:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. <strong>Transfer XYZ tokens - </strong>You approve transferring XYZ
    tokens out of your wallet to another wallet (in this case, the creator of
    the reward). We integrated Thirdweb's SDK retrieve the XYZ token(s) from its
    smart contract. This SDK allows us to access the necessary functions within
    the token's smart contract, including the transfer function. When redeeming
    a reward, the transfer function is called, requiring two arguments: the
    wallet address of the reward creator and the number of XYZ tokens to
    transfer.
    <br />
    <br />
    To streamline the transaction process, we also incorporated a Relayer
    service as part of our Thirdweb's SDK configurations. When you sign the
    transaction to initiate the burning process, the Relayer service is
    triggered. Its purpose is to pay for transaction gas fees on your behalf.

    The NFT Attendance tokens were deployed on an ERC1155 smart contract through
    Thirdweb. The contract contains numerous extensions, including the burn and
    mint functions.
    <br />
    <br />
    When you sign the transaction to redeem the NFT Guild Sticker reward, two
    blockchain transactions occur:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. <strong>Burn tokens - </strong>Burning your NFT Attendance tokens
    permanently removes them from circulation and prevents them from being used
    again. We integrated Thirdweb's SDK retrieve the NFT Attendance token from
    its smart contract. This SDK allows us to access the necessary functions
    within the token's smart contract, including the burn function. When
    redeeming a reward, the burn function is called, requiring two arguments:
    the NFT Attendance token ID and the number of tokens to burn.
    <br />
    <br />
    To streamline the transaction process, we also incorporated a Relayer
    service as part of our Thirdweb's SDK configurations. When you sign the
    transaction to initiate the burning process, the Relayer service is
    triggered. Its purpose is to pay for transaction gas fees on your behalf.
    Read more on the Relayer service below.
    <br />
    <br />
    2. <strong>Mint NFT Guild Sticker token - </strong>In order to mint from the
    contract, a wallet needs to be granted the "Minter" role. Instead of
    individually assigning the "Minter" role to each user's wallet, we
    streamlined the process by designating a single root application wallet with
    the "Minter" role. This root wallet handles the minting of the NFT Guild
    Sticker token, as well as its transfer to your wallet and payment of gas
    fees on your behalf.
    <br />
    <br />
    To achieve this, we used ethers.js to establish a connection with the smart
    contract so that we could mint the token (and sign the transaction) from the
    root application wallet to your wallet.

    service, which covers the transaction fees on your behalf when you redeem
    rewards.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Relayer service creates a wallet that the XYZ Marketplace team funds.
    When you sign a transaction (i.e. to transfer or burn your tokens), the
    request is sent to our Relayer, which takes your transaction, pays the
    required gas fees, and submits the transaction to the blockchain network on
    your behalf.
    <br />
    <br />
    This allows for a seamless and gas-less experience, allowing you to fully
    enjoy the benefits of redeeming rewards without any transactional burdens.

    answer: (

        When you redeem a reward that accepts XYZ tokens, your XYZ tokens will
        be transferred out of your wallet to the reward creator's wallet. The
        specific number of XYZ tokens required for each reward will vary,
        depending on the creator's corresponding price that's assigned to the
        reward. By redeeming a reward with your XYZ tokens, you'll be
        contributing to the circulation and utilization of the XYZ token within
        the XYZ Marketplace ecosystem!
